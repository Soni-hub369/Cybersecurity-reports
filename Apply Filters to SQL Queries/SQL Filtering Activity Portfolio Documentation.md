# SQL Filtering Activity: Portfolio Documentation

## Activity Overview  
This activity demonstrates my ability to use SQL filters (`AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` operators) to investigate potential security issues in an organization’s system.  

The purpose of this document is to:  
- Show practical experience applying SQL in a cybersecurity context.  
- Provide examples that can be shared in a professional cybersecurity portfolio.  
- Support interview preparation by clearly explaining the reasoning behind each query.  

By completing this activity, I have gained hands-on practice in filtering and analyzing login and employee data using SQL. This type of documentation helps highlight technical problem-solving skills to future employers and recruiters.

## Scenario  
As a security professional in a large organization, one of my key responsibilities is to help keep the system secure by investigating unusual activity.  

Recently, I discovered potential security issues involving **login attempts** and **employee machines**.  

### My Task  
- Examine the organization’s data stored in two key tables:  
  - `log_in_attempts` (records of login activity)  
  - `employees` (employee details including department and office location)  
- Use SQL filters to:  
  - Identify failed or suspicious login attempts.  
  - Investigate login activity on specific dates or from unusual locations.  
  - Retrieve employee information to determine which computers require updates.  

This process required building SQL queries that combined **AND**, **OR**, and **NOT** operators, as well as using pattern matching with `LIKE`.

## Relevance  
- **Security investigation:** Queries allowed me to filter suspicious login activity and detect risks.  
- **System maintenance:** Queries helped identify which employee machines required updates.  
- **Portfolio building:** This exercise demonstrates practical SQL skills in a security-focused scenario, making it valuable for interviews and professional development.
