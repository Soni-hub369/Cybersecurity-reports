Summary: This report presents an analysis of a captured TCPDump traffic log. The goal is to identify potential signs of brute-force or scanning activity based on the captured network behavior. The investigation includes protocol identification, a detailed incident summary, and a professional remediation recommendation.
                                              ======================================================================

## üîπ Section 1: Identify the Network Protocol Involved in the Incident

**The protocol involved in the incident is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).**  
Since the issue was with accessing the web server for `yummyrecipesforme.com`, we know that requests to web servers for web pages involve HTTP traffic.

When we ran `tcpdump` and accessed the website, the corresponding tcpdump log file showed the usage of the HTTP protocol. The malicious file is observed being transported to the users‚Äô computers using the HTTP protocol at the application layer.

## üîπ Section 2: Document the Incident

Several customers contacted the website‚Äôs helpdesk stating that when they visited the site, they were prompted to download and run a file that claimed to contain new recipes. Their personal computers began operating slowly afterward.

The website owner attempted to log into the web server but discovered they had been locked out of their account. A cybersecurity analyst opened the website in a sandbox environment to avoid impacting the company‚Äôs network and ran `tcpdump` to capture the network packets generated by interacting with the site.

The analyst was prompted to download a file claiming to give access to free recipes, accepted the download, and ran it. The browser then redirected the analyst to a fake website (`greatrecipesforme.com`).

Upon inspecting the tcpdump log, the analyst saw that the browser initially requested the IP address for `yummyrecipesforme.com`. Once a connection was made via HTTP, the download was executed. The logs showed a sudden shift in traffic as the browser then resolved a new IP address for `greatrecipesforme.com` and redirected the session.

Later, a senior cybersecurity analyst inspected the downloaded file and the website‚Äôs source code. It was discovered that an attacker had injected malicious code that disguised the file as a browser update. Since the website owner confirmed they were locked out of their admin account, it is believed that the attacker performed a brute force attack to gain access and change the password. The execution of the malicious file compromised users‚Äô machines.

## üîπ Section 3: Recommend One Remediation for Brute Force Attacks

One key remediation plan the team recommends is to **disallow previously used passwords**, particularly default passwords. Since the attacker appears to have used a default or reused password to log in, this measure would prevent similar intrusions.

Additionally, the team recommends enforcing **regular password updates**. This ensures that even if a password is compromised, it has a short life span, reducing the attacker's window of opportunity.

A final and crucial solution is to implement **two-factor authentication (2FA)**. With 2FA, users must provide not only a password but also a second authentication factor such as a one-time passcode (OTP) sent via email or phone. This significantly reduces the likelihood of successful brute force attacks, as gaining access would require both factors.
