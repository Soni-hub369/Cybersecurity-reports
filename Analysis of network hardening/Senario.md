# 🧪 Network Hardening Scenario: Social Media Organization Data Breach
_______________________________________________________________________

## 🧠 Scenario Overview

You are a security analyst working for a social media organization that recently experienced a major **data breach**. This breach compromised the personal information of several customers, including their **names and physical addresses**.

Your task is to investigate the root causes of this incident and help your organization implement **network hardening practices** to reduce the likelihood of future attacks.

==============================================================================================================================================================================================

## 🔍 Root Cause Summary

Upon conducting a network inspection, four key vulnerabilities were identified:

1. **Shared Passwords** — Employees were found to be using and sharing common passwords across devices.
2. **Default Admin Password** — The database administrator account was using its factory-default password, making it an easy target.
3. **Unconfigured Firewalls** — No firewall rules were in place to filter incoming or outgoing traffic.
4. **Lack of MFA** — Systems did not use multifactor authentication (MFA), increasing risk of account compromise.

If these vulnerabilities remain unaddressed, the organization will remain vulnerable to **data theft, unauthorized access, brute force attacks, and lateral movement** across the network.

===============================================================================================================================================================================================

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze the existing weaknesses in the organization’s network.
- Select effective security hardening tools or methods.
- Provide actionable recommendations for long-term risk reduction.
- Document all findings in a professional security risk assessment.

===============================================================================================================================================================================================


## 📘 What to Expect in the Full Report

The accompanying report (`incident-report.md`) will include:

- Detailed explanation of the breach
- Selected hardening tools (e.g., MFA, password policies, firewall rules)
- Justifications for each method based on industry standards
- Recommendations for ongoing security monitoring and compliance
